  <p class="p2">The first time I Filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily,there are much more 
     accessible places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene, 
     consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55 and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.

  <p class="p2"> In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily 
     the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more particles interact with the 
     atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperatures 
     in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
