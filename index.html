    <p class="p1"><b>Iceland</b> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset 
        by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

            <p class= "p4">The Aurora Borealis takes its name from th Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name 
                for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.<br>
                The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon
                created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This
                releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.

            <p class= "p4">When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake-
                namely, it's 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year round and takes
                place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are 
                offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).
